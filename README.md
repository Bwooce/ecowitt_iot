# ecowitt_iot custom integration for HACS HomeAssistant

This custom integration supports the WFC01 WittFlow water timer and the AC1100 WittSwitch smart plug.

Created as the existing core ecowitt integration is a push based implementation (runs a server listening for weather station data), and the Ecowitt IOT devices need a polling/local api approach. Smooshing them together seemed overly complicated, so this is a different standalone integration. There's no cross-over interference with the core ecowitt integration, they're not working with the same end-devices, and if you have both Ecowitt IOT and non-IOT (weatherstation, soil sensors) devices then you want both this integration and the core one [docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ecowitt/).

# Status
## In active development

## WFC01 Wittflow water timer
Working, pending update to add more tests and better cope with the activation delay where the switch un-sets itself while the Ecowitt gateway/device are 
## AC1100 WittSwitch smart plug 
Untested (unowned). Should work but feedback welcome
